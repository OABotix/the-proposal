            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>The Anchor Collective was founded in 2020 in the heart of Cape Town's Southern Suburbs by a group of young Christian creatives, teachers, and community builders. The idea was born after a community youth camp revealed the deep need for year-round mentorship, faith-based community, and spaces to create and belong.</p>
            <p>What started as Friday night poetry jams and soccer matches at a local church hall has grown into a vibrant collective that offers creative workshops, mental health check-ins, tutoring sessions, and sports mentorships â€” all rooted in love, faith, and community.</p>
